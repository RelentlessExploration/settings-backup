  // Place your snippets for typescript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Type GraphQL Resolver - Mutation": {
    "prefix": "mutation",
    "body": [
      "import { Resolver, Mutation } from \"type-graphql\";",
      "",
      "@Resolver()",
      "export class $1Resolver {",
      "  @Mutation()",
      "  async $2() {}",
      "}"

  "Type GraphQL Resolver - Query": {

    "body": [
      "import { Resolver, Query } from \"type-graphql\";",
      "",
      "@Resolver()",
      "export class $1Resolver {",

      "  async $2() {}",
